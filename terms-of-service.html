    <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Union, we adhere to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"). For users in the United Kingdom, we adhere to the GDPR as enshrined in the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

    <h2>Consent</h2>
    <p>By using our Site, users agree that they consent to the conditions set out in this Privacy Policy. When the legal basis for us processing your personal data is that you have provided your consent to that processing, you may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, it will not make processing which we completed before you withdrew your consent unlawful.</p>

    <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>We collect and process personal data about users in the EU only when we have a legal basis for doing so under Article 6 of the GDPR. We rely on the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users have provided their consent to the processing of their data for one or more specific purposes</li>
      <li>Processing of user personal data is necessary for us to take, at the request of a user, steps before entering a contract or for the performance of a contract to which a user is a party</li>
      <li>Processing of user personal data is necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Personal Data</h2>
    <p>Data collected on our Site will only be used for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy or indicated on the relevant pages of our Site. We will not use your data beyond what we disclose in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Who We Share Personal Data With</h2>
    <p><strong>Employees:</strong> We may disclose user data to any member of our organization who reasonably needs access to user data to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Other Disclosures:</strong> We will not sell or share your data with other third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the law requires it</li>
      <li>If it is required for any legal proceeding</li>
      <li>To prove or protect our legal rights</li>
      <li>To buyers or potential buyers of this company in the event that we seek to sell the company</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you follow hyperlinks from our Site to another Site, please note that we are not responsible for and have no control over their privacy policies and practices.</p>

    <h2>How Long We Store Personal Data</h2>
    <p>User data will be stored until the purpose the data was collected for has been achieved. You will be notified if your data is kept for longer than this period.</p>

    <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>In order to protect your security, we use secure encryption to protect all of your data on servers in secure facilities. All data is only accessible by authorized personnel. While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>

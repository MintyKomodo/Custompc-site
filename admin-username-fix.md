# Admin Username Validation Fix - Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The admin username "Minty-Komodo" was being rejected during account creation because the username validation pattern only allowed letters, numbers, and underscores, but not hyphens.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Updated Username Validation Pattern
**Before:** `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/` (letters, numbers, underscores only)
**After:** `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/` (letters, numbers, underscores, AND hyphens)

### Updated Error Message
**Before:** "Username can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores"
**After:** "Username can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens"

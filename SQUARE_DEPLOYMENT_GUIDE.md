## Production Checklist

### 1. Square Developer Account Setup
1. **Create Square Account**: Go to [Square Developer Dashboard](https://developer.squareup.com/)
2. **Create Application**: 
   - Name: "CustomPC.tech Payment System"
   - Description: "Payment processing for custom PC builds"
3. **Get Credentials**:
   - Application ID (starts with `sq0idp-`)
   - Location ID (your business location)
   - Access Token (for backend API)

### 2. Update Configuration
Edit `square-config.js` and replace:
```javascript
production: {
    applicationId: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_ID', // Replace with actual
    locationId: 'YOUR_PRODUCTION_LOCATION_ID',       // Replace with actual
    // ... rest stays the same
}
```

### 3. Backend Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install express squareup crypto
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_production_access_token
   SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_production_location_id
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

3. **Deploy Backend**: Use the `square-backend-example.js` as your starting point

### 4. SSL Certificate
- Square requires HTTPS in production
- Ensure your domain has a valid SSL certificate

### 5. Domain Verification
- Add your production domain to Square's allowed domains in the developer dashboard

### 6. Testing Checklist
Before going live, test:
- [ ] Payment processing with real test cards
- [ ] Customer creation and card saving
- [ ] Error handling (declined cards, network issues)
- [ ] Admin authentication
- [ ] Transaction history
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness

### 7. Go Live Steps
1. Update `square-config.js` production credentials
2. Deploy backend with production environment variables
3. Test with Square's test cards in production environment
4. Process a small real transaction to verify
5. Monitor for any errors

## Test Cards for Production Testing
Square provides test cards that work in production sandbox mode:
- **Visa**: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- **Mastercard**: 5555 5555 5555 4444
- **American Express**: 3782 822463 10005
- **CVV**: Any 3-4 digits
- **Expiry**: Any future date

## Security Considerations
- ✅ All payment data is handled by Square (PCI compliant)
- ✅ No sensitive card data stored on your servers
- ✅ HTTPS required for production
- ✅ Admin authentication protects payment interface
- ✅ Input validation prevents injection attacks

## Monitoring & Maintenance
1. **Square Dashboard**: Monitor transactions, refunds, disputes
2. **Error Logging**: Check browser console and server logs
3. **Customer Support**: Handle payment issues through Square's tools
4. **Updates**: Keep Square SDK updated

## Estimated Timeline

- **Testing**: 1-2 hours (comprehensive testing)
- **Go Live**: 30 minutes (final configuration switch)

## Cost Structure
- **Square Fees**: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction (standard rate)
- **No monthly fees** for basic payment processing
- **Volume discounts** available for high transaction volumes

Your payment system is production-ready! The main work is getting your Square credentials and deploying the backend API.
